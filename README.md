Recognizing human emotions with convolutional network

This is a snap shot of CS512 (computer vision) course project

It detectes face in the image and then attempts to identify emotion expressed by the person

Emotion identification is done by the neural network. The architecture is built around Xception conv net

Training is done on FER2013 dataset
